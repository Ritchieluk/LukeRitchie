# LukeRitchie.me
The repository for the front end of my personal site.

### Goals
* Further strengthen my knowledge of Vue, web development, and web deployment
* Create a single source for my information that enhances the information already stored on my Linkedin or Github
* Create pages for demos of my projects and school work
* Deploy the front end using Github Pages or AWS
* Link it to a back end (TBD)
* Have fun working on a personal project
